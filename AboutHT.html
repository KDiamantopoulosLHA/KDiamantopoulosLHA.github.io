            <h1 style="font-family: Arial;">Date of birth</h1>
            <p style="font-family: Arial;">Harriet Tubman believes she was born in 1825, but her tombstone says 1920. At birth, she was given the name Araminta Ross. She was born in Dorchester County, Maryland. Tubman died in 1913, in Auburn New York.</p>
            <h1 style="font-family: Arial;">Harriet Tubman's nickname</h1>
            <p style="font-family: Arial;">She was nicknamed Moses when she was older because she would make countless trips south to free friends and family. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which allowed escaped slaves to be captured and returned to their owners, made her work of freeing slaves harder.</p>
            <h1 style="font-family: Arial;">Early Life</h1>
            <p style="font-family: Arial;">When she was little her mother called her Minty. Her parents names were Harriet Green and Ben Ross. They had nine kids in total. Harriet Had four sisters and four brothers. She was the fifth child to be born. All her family members were born into slavery.
            When she was five years old, she was given her first job which was taking care of an infant. She was hit over the head at age twelve when helping a slave flee a grocery store when his owner was not looking. For the rest of her life after this injury she would randomly fall asleep anywhere and couldnt be woken. When she was a teenager she started working for John Steward. While working for John, chopping timber, she made more money than she ever had and would save it for when she escaped.</p>
            <h1 style="font-family: Arial;">Marriage</h1>
            <p style="font-family: Arial,  ;">She married John Tubman, a free African American, in 1844. Since she was a slave, if they had any children, they would be given the same status as their mother and be slaves as well. In 1849, there were rumors her and her brothers would be sold to help pay for their owners debt. Their owner died before he could. Harriet decided then that she needed to come up with an escape plan, because she did not want to be sold to the south. She had money saved up and knew some people in the underground railroad. She took her mother's first name and her husband's last name as to not leave traces behind.</p>
