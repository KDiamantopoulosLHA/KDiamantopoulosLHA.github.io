            <h1 style="font-family: Times;">Harriet Tubman's first trip on Undergrouund Railroad</h1>
            <p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 20px">September 17th, 1849, she gathered her brother and they escaped together. Her brothers changed their minds and decided to return and Harriet went with them. She very soon after escaped again without her brothers but void to return and free them. She traveled at night and was helped by members of the underground railroad. She followed the path many others did. Families would pretend Harriet was their slave in the mornings, and at night would bring her to the next family who would help her escape further north. Her journey was nearly 90 miles and it is unclear how long it took her to make it. She crossed the line into Pennsylvania where slavery was illegal. She worked many jobs in Philadelphia to make money to help her family escape.</p>
            <h1 style="font-family: Times;">Her various Underground Railroad trips</h1>
            <p style="font-family: Times; font-size: 20px">Harriet tried for years to save her sister Rachel but was unsuccessful. In December of 1860 she went to Dorchester Country to get Rachel and her two young children, Ben and Angerine, only to discover that she had passed away. She was unable to find her children. Harriet brought the Ennals family to freedom, because she refused to return without helping someone. After weeks of traveling north the Ennals arrived safely in St Catharines, Ontario.
            
            This was Harriet's last trip on the Underground Railroad. The following year was the start of the American Civil War and the effort was moved above ground. At the start she was a nurse, a cook and a recruiter. Afterwards she worked as a spy and a scout.
            
            For 10 years Tubman returned 19 times, freeing around 300 slaves. She was proud to have never lost a passenger. Tubmans missions were admired by those who supported the abolition of slavery. Black and white abolitionist provided her with funds to continue her activities.</p>
            <h1 style="font-family: Times;">Her strategies</h1>
            <p>Harriet developed strategies throughout her years to free slaves. She would have urged slaves to escape from their owners on Saturday, because Sunday was a rest day and the owner would not find out until Monday morning. She always traveled at night and would rest during the day. She followed the North Star and when it was a cloudy night she would observe the moss growing on the north side of dead tree trunks. To avoid slave catchers, she would use back roads, waterways, mountains and swamps.</p>
            <h1 style="font-family: Times;">Her last trip</h1>
            <p>One of Harriet's last trips was to bring her parents north. Her father, Ben, was a free man but her mother, Rit, was not free. In 1855, Ben purchased Rit from Eliza Brodess for $20. In 1857 Ben was in trouble for having harbored fugitives in his home. Harriet quickly departed south to help her parents in what would be her only known expedition to have taken place in the summer. It was hard to transport her elderly parents who could not walk long distances. She made a makeshift carriage and managed to get them to Canada. They stayed in St Catharines where other relatives had made their homes.
